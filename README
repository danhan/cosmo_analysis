5-13
1 SpaceRasterIndexing Test with HBase , found 61 true positive
2 do the statistics on Cosmology data, found 65 points near to the given point
3 SpaceQuadTreeIndexing Test with the file, found 2 true positive

Problem:
1 Bug: SpaceOctreeIndexing has bugs, because it cannot find the correct number of near points
2 Bug: SpaceRasterIndexing has bugs, because it missed 4 points
3 Bug: SpaceRasterIndexing is slow when use the column and timestamp filter, but with timestamp range will get better performance.
